__Thrust__ is a small project that contains some useful rake tasks to run Cedar specs and deploy iOS applications to TestFlight.
   
    rake autotag:list                         # Show the commit that is currently deployed to each environment
    rake clean                                # Clean all targets
    rake focused_specs                        # Print out names of files containing focused specs
    rake nof                                  # Remove any focus from specs
    rake set_build_number[build_number]       # Set build number
    rake spec_bundle[device_name,os_version]  # Run the FakeProject scheme
    rake spec_suite[device_name,os_version]   # Run the SpecSuite target
    rake mac_suite[device_name,os_version]    # Run the MacSpecSuite target
    rake testflight:staging                   # Deploy iOS build to staging (use NOTIFY=false to prevent team notification)
    rake testflight:demo                      # Deploy iOS build to demo (use NOTIFY=false to prevent team notification)
    rake trim                                 # Trim whitespace


# Installation

(Note: **Thrust** requires ruby >= 1.9.3)

**Thrust** should be installed as a gem.  It comes with an installer that will set up your Rakefile and create an example configuration file.

    gem install thrust
    thrust install

After installation, change the name of `thrust.example.yml` to `thrust.yml` and update the configuration as needed.

If you're using **Thrust** to run specs for an iOS app and do not have *ios-sim* installed, you can find it at https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim or install it using homebrew:
    
    brew install ios-sim

If you had **Thrust** previously installed as a submodule, we recommend that you remove the submodule and now use **Thrust** as a gem.  This is because there are runtime dependencies that will not get installed properly if **Thrust** is installed as a submodule.

# Changelog

## Version 0.6

* Drops Android support.

* Adds `spec_directories` configuration key to `thrust.yml`.  This allows you to specify from where `rake nof` removes focused specs.

* Updates `ios_spec_targets` to require the `scheme` name instead of the `target` name.  The `target` key is no longer used.

* Adds support for specifying the MacOSX sdk version in a spec target configuration.  E.g. `build_sdk` can now be set to `macosx10.9` or `macosx10.10`.  Run `xcodebuild -showsdks` to see the full list of available sdks.

## Version 0.5

##### Version 0.5 introduced a lot of changes.  Please see the *Upgrading* section below after installing the update.

* Removes support for waxsim. Specify `ios_sim_path` to use a non-system installed version of ios-sim.

* Unifies configuration of Cedar Spec Suites and Cedar/iOS/OSX test bundles in `thrust.yml` (breaking configuration changes)

* Fixes hardcoded bundle test destination which was broken in Xcode 6+

* Allows bundles to be built for architectures specified in Xcode project (removes hardcoded ARCHS flag)

* Adds support for specifying an alternate path to ios-sim

* Adds additional options for setting build numbers when deploying to TestFlight by setting the `versioning_method` key in the `thrust.yml`.  The options are:
    * 'timestamp-sha': Sets the build number to a combo of the current date and the SHA of the current commit.  e.g. '1402021234-f57bea'
    * 'commits': Sets the build number to the number of commits in the commit history
    * 'none': Does not update the build number during deploy
    * Default: When you leave the key blank, it defaults to setting the build number to the SHA of the current commit.

* Adds support for setting the TestFlight api token from the command line: `TESTFLIGHT_API_TOKEN='your-api-token' rake testflight:deploy`

* Adds support for deploying from a specific tag.  E.g. if your CI machine tags every successful build with a 'ci' tag, then specify the `tag` key in your deployment configuration to deploy the last successful build.  The feature assumes that the tags conform to the style generated by the [auto_tagger](https://github.com/zilkey/auto_tagger) gem.

* Adds support for specifying `device_name` and `os_version` as arguments to the rake task for each spec target.  Defaults for these should be set in the `thrust.yml`.

## Version 0.4

* Added support for Xcode 6 and ios-sim 3.x.  You should now specify `device_type_id` in your `thrust.yml` instead of `device`.

## Version 0.3

* **Thrust** can now build against Xcode workspaces. In your `thrust.yml` file:

  * Replace the `project_name` with a `workspace_name`.

  * For each build in your `ios_spec_targets`, include `scheme` to specify the scheme to use along with the target.

* If you are upgrading from Version 0.2 or for an example, run `thrust install` and look at the generated `thrust.example.yml`.

## Version 0.2

* **Thrust** should now be installed as a gem, not a submodule.  Running `thrust install` after installation sets up the `Rakefile` and creates an example `thrust.yml`.

* The code has been cleaned up and modularized, making it easier to add new features in the future.

* **Thrust** now supports deploying Android apps to TestFlight.  **Thrust** auto-detects whether your project is Android or iOS and will generate the appropriate rake tasks.

* The structure of `thrust.yml` has been updated, and the names of certain keys have changed to make their meaning clearer.

* All deployments are tagged using [auto_tagger](https://github.com/zilkey/auto_tagger). Run `rake autotag:list` to see which commits are deployed to each environment.

* Deploy notes can be auto-generated from commit messages. Set `note_generation_method` to `autotag` in `thrust.yml` to use this feature.

* Build numbers are no longer auto-incremented during deployment.  Instead, the build number is set to the short SHA of the commit that is being deployed.  Deployment history is managed by auto_tagger.

* You no longer have to be in sync with _origin_ to deploy to TestFlight.

## Version 0.1

* The 'specs' configuration has been replaced by an array of specs configurations, called 'spec_targets'. This is to allow you to specify multiple targets to be run as specs - for instance, you may wish to run a set of integration tests separately from your unit tests. Running one of these commands will clean the default build configuration list (AdHoc, Debug, Release).

* Adds 'focused_specs' and 'nof' tasks to show files with focused specs and to remove them, respectively.

* Adds 'current_version' task to show the current build version of the app.

* TestFlight deploys now prompt the user for a deployment message

* Removes adding to default tasks. This is now your responsibility - please define in your own Rakefile if you need to add to the default task. e.g. `task :default => [:specs :something_random]`

* Adds support for non-standard app names defined in your XCode project. These are determined by looking for the first ".app" file it can find in the build folder and basing the name off that file.

* Adds support for disabling incrementing the build number during a TestFlight deploy. This is via the 'increments_build_number' configuration setting under a distribution in your thrust.yml.

## Overriding config options

### Specifying API Token at deploy time

You can change the API token for a TestFlight upload with the `TESTFLIGHT_API_TOKEN` environment variable. This is useful when different members want to use their own tokens to deploy without having to change `thrust.yml` and commiting again.

### Ignoring Git during deploys

TestFlight deployment requires you to be in a clean git repo and to be at the head of your current branch. You can disable this by setting the environment variable `IGNORE_GIT=1`. **We do not recommend this.** If your git repository is not clean, deployment will discard all your uncommitted changes.

### Notifying distribution lists

Deploying to TestFlight will automatically notify all of the people on your TestFlight distribution list.  If you would prefer not to notify them, then you can change the `notify` value in `thrust.yml` for that distribution list. You can also set the environment variable `NOTIFY` to false, e.g:

    NOTIFY=false rake testflight:staging

# Upgrading

Periodically new thrust versions will require changes to your `thrust.yml` configuration.  Look in the ***Upgrading Instructions*** section below for guidance on how to upgrade from the previous version.  If you need to upgrade multiple versions, you may want to just re-create your configuration from the `example.yml`.

Once you upgrade make sure to add/update the 'thrust_version' key in the configuration to the new version.


## Upgrading Instructions

### Upgrading to Version 0.6

In your `thrust.yml`, update all spec configurations under `ios_spec_targets` to specify the spec `scheme` instead of the `target`. 

### Upgrading to Version 0.5

Version 0.5 required many updates to **Thrust** thanks to the releases of Xcode 6, Yosemite, and ios-sim 3.0.  In order to update successfully to version 0.5, we recommend that you:

 * Use Xcode 6
 * Install or upgrade to ios-sim 3.0 (`brew install ios-sim` or `brew upgrade ios-sim`)
 * Use OS X Mavericks or Yosemite
 
There are also significant changes to the keys in the `thrust.yml` configuration file.

Older `thrust.yml` files asked for `runtime_sdk` and `device`. In **Thrust** 0.5, these keys have been removed and you should instead specify `device_name` and `os_version` in `thrust.yml`, for example:

```
  ...
  specs:
	device_name: iPhone-6
	os_version: 8.1
  ...
```

You can run `ios-sim showdevicetypes` to see the list of available devices and runtime iOS versions.

### Upgrading from Version 0.1 to Version 0.2

We recommend generating a new file from the `thrust.example.yml` and then copying your project configuration into that file. Please see the comments in `thrust.example.yml` for more information.

You should remove `Dir.glob('Vendor/thrust/lib/tasks/*.rake').each { |r| import r }` from your Rakefile before running `thrust install`.

## CI Setup

### Setting up Jenkins to work with Thrust

To use **Thrust** on CI, you should include it in a Gemfile in your project root so the same version of the gem will be installed on the CI box as on your local machine.  Your CI box should also have ruby >= 1.9.3, bundler and ios-sim.
 
Here is an example .sh script for running specs with **Thrust** on Jenkins (in the Execute shell section of your job configuration).

```
#!/bin/bash --login

bundle install
git submodule update --init --recursive

CC= bundle exec rake specs
```
